        <h2><b>Sample Content</b></h2>
        A <strong>multi-tier enterprise application </strong>consists of two types of objects: <strong>application logic compo-<br>
        nents</strong> and <strong>persistent data objects</strong>. Application logic components represent actions and define <br>
        methods that perform common tasks such as calculating the order price, customer credit card <br>
        billing and so on. Sessions beans model the application logic components as they contain the logic <br>
        to perform the application tasks. <br/><br>

        It is easy and simple to manage the business data present in large organizations as objects rather <br>
        than relational rows in a database. Business data when treated as objects are easy to handle and <br>
        manage as they are compact in nature. <br><br>

        <pre>Entities   are   not   associated   with   only   EJBs   and   can   be   used   in</pre>
        <strong>Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE)</strong> environment. The differences between an Entity and a Session <br>
        bean are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Entities have a clint-visibility and a persistent identity that is distinct from their object<br>
            reference. Each entity is distinct from the other because of their identities. Clients can use<br>
            identities to pass the reference of an entity to other applications. However, this is not<br>
            possible with Session beans.</li>
            <li>Entity bean cannot be accessed remotely, whereas Session beans can be accessed locally as<br>
            well as remotely.</li>
            <li>Entity's lifetime is not dependent on the application's lifetime. Entity bean have a much<br>
            longer lifetime than a client's session as it depends on how long the data is present in the <br>
            database.</li>
            <li>Entities represent data in a storage that is permanent as well as fault-tolerant and hence,<br>
            they are long lasting and can survive application server or database crash. This data can be <br>
            reconstructed in the memory. Hence, it can be said that entity is an in-memory<br>
            representation of persistent data that:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be loaded from persistent store and its field populated with the stored data</li>
                <li>Can be modified in-memory to change the data values</li>
                <li>Can be saved and correspondingly database is updated</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
