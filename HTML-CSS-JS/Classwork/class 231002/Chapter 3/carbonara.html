        <h2>About Carbonara</h2>
        <p>It's a beautiful, classic Italian pasta dish that's so creamy, you could swear there's a good amount of cream in it. But today, we're making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way. No cream. Just eggs, cheese, and a splash of starchy pasta water.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>You will only need a few Ingredients in order to make this delicious dish:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Guanciale</b> - This is a key ingredient in carbonara, and is a cured fatty pork that is similar to bacon and pancetta. It adds adds flavour into the dish and the fat makes the sauce creamy when mixed with the egg and starchy pasta cooking water.</li>
            <br><li><b>Parmigiano Reggiano</b> - This is basically a premium parmesan that’s been aged so it has more complex flavours. It adds salt into the sauce as well as thickening it.</li>
            <br><li><b>Spaghetti</b></li>
            <br><li><b>Eggs</b></li>
            <br><li><b>Pepper</b></li>
            <br><li><b>Salt</b> - do NOT add salt into the sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Let's talk Cooking</h2>
        <p>Sauté guanciale until golden. Mix hot cooked pasta vigorously with the guanciale, egg, cheese and a splash of pasta cooking water and watch as it transforms into a luxurious, creamy sauce.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Batons</b> - Cut the guanciale into thick batons</li>
            <li><b>Finely grate</b> the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino</li>
            <li><b>Sauce</b> - Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
            <li><b>Cooking the pasta</b> - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.</li>
            <li><b>Reserve 1 cup of pasta water</b></li>
            <li><b>Cook Guanciale</b> - until golden brown</li>
            <li><b>Toss Pasta in Guanciale</b> - toss the pasta into the pan with the guancialle and give it a mix</li>
            <li><b>Pasta Water</b> - put 1/2 cup of the pasta you reserved into and mix vigorously</li>
            <li><b>Serve</b></li>
        </ol>
